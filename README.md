# Tailframe CSS

A < 15KB CSS library, elegantly built on Tailwind CSS.

## When will v1 be released?

Later this year. I'm currently working on the documentation and the website and making the components much better!

## How to run?

Download the latest version of go on your system (https://go.dev)
Download the latest version of bun.js on your system (https://bun.sh)
Download the actionfile command runner (https://github.com/lassejlv/action)

Then simply run

  ```bash
  action compile # or without the compile flag. Beacuse the compile cmd is the first one in the .actions file
  ```

  And you're done!
